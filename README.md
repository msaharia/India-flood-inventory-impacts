# India Flood Inventory - Impacts v2.0 

Used to calculate the District Flood Severity Index (DFSI)

This repo hosts the India Flood Inventory with Impacts (IFI-Impacts) database. It contains flood event data sourced from the Indian Meteorological Department from 1967-2023. It has undergone extensive cleaning to make it suitable for analysis.

The notebook shows the development of the District Flood Severity Index (DFSI) map. To develop the DFSI, a reanalysis of the Indian Land Data Assimilation was used.
